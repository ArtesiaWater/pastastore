# Running MongoDB with docker

This readme explains how to get the MongoDB docker container up and running.

## Using `docker-compose`

Create and start the MongoDB docker container using `docker-compose`.
The `docker-compose.yml` file describes the container.

1.  Install Docker (i.e.
    [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop))

2.  Open a terminal and navigate to `/dockerfiles`.

3.  Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the docker container running MongoDB.
    The `-d` flag runs the container in the background. This command uses the
    `docker-compose.yml` file by default.

4.  View your running containers with `docker ps -a`.

To stop the container run `docker-compose stop` in a terminal.

Once the docker container exists, starting it using the `docker-compose up`
command might fail. Use `docker start mongodb` from the terminal instead.
Check if it is running using `docker ps -a`.

## Manual set-up

The following steps describe the manual set-up of the docker container for
MongoDB. It is recommended to use the `docker-compose` method above, but this
is left here as a reference.

1.  Install Docker (i.e.
    [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)).

2.  Open a terminal and pull the mongodb image by typing `docker pull mongo`.

3.  To ensure a persistent volume (i.e. your data is kept even if you shutdown
    your docker container running mongodb) run the following command before
    starting the mongo database, e.g. `docker volume create --name=mongodata`

4.  Start the docker container on localhost by running e.g.
    `docker run --mongodb -v mongodata:/data/db -d -p 27017:27017 mongo`

5.  View your running containers with `docker ps -a`

Stop the container with the command: `docker stop mongodb`.

(Re)start the container (after it has been created) by typing
`docker start mongodb` in a terminal.
